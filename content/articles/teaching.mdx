## Teach youngsters to code, keep the web alive.

Welcome! I use this blog to expirement with tools. Here's a list of what's under the hood. Checkout the code on [GitHub](#).

Intro: Communication is important, especially in these times. Non walled garden. Creative and fun intro to coding! Here’s my home grown curriculum (WIP) and lessons learned.

Class 1.

In person is better !

Pace is way slower!!

Learn by doing!

Start broad. Don’t go into the intricacies of CSS box shadows, be like “copy and paste a shadow” . Inquisitive kids can go deep in there own, our will ask questions later. Going deep in a subject will lose them. Deep is for experts, We’re just trying to inspire them at this point. Motivation is a force multiplier: keep them motivated to learn, make it like play.

Let them drive! (Abbey, can you screen share and I’ll tell you what to type)

Let them direct you

End with cliff hangers!

Dumb it WAY down. I was hoping we would cover XYZ but After the first class I learned the pace should Be MUCH SLOWRR. Every class I calibrated my expectations (lower) and every time it wasn’t low enough. Start with the most simple, basic, stuff.

Give them the guide but stop to ask question: like, how should we make this page look better

You will be surprised how much they don’t know, what’s “code”. What’s a file? They will butcher syntax no matter how simple. it would be like me walking into the shop of an airplane mechanic.

Key is to have them create and see the output of their work. Not a lecture, it’s more like a pottery class where the students learn by doing. They will hit walls (like how come this isn’t working : ex) but Overcoming those little bugs give them a huge sense of accomplishment and fuel their interest.

Bake in time for Free play. Follow along but after you don’t do it my way. Choose your own images. Your own copy. Your own colours.

Seeing the results will unlock the desire to learn. Like “how do in make this thing have a shadow ”. Well copy this

Tell them “
