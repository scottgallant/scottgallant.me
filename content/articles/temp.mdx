  This title makes me cringe


  I’m a life long web developer and web (2) enthusiast. I believe in the open
  web. My company’s mission is to redefine how we publish to the web. Yet I
  observe the world choosing social platforms over the open web and I have a
  hypothesis as to why. 


  Mention that I’m sad to see this trend. 


  I read Tom’s post and although he has some good ideas, I think he really
  misses the mark.

  > Social networks are universally more restrictive than web pages but also
  more fun in significant ways, chief amongst them being that more people can
  participate. What if the rest of the web have that simplicity and immediacy,
  but without the centralization? What if we could start over?


  > The appeal of social networks

  > The appeal of social networks is partly because they let us create documents
  without thinking about web technology, and they provide guarantees around
  performance, accessibility, and polish that otherwise would take up our time.
  You don’t have to think about whether your last Facebook post will load
  quickly on your friend’s phone or whether your Instagram post will be
  correctly cropped and resized in the timeline - those things are taken care
  of.


  > To some extent, this doesn’t need to be something that only social networks
  provide, though: standards like RSS and services like Instapaper show that
  pleasing formatting and distribution can be done at the platform level and be
  provided on top of existing vanilla websites.


  My notes


  Ask myself why someone publishes to a network instead of a website. Why do I
  browse google maps to find my restaurant hours? Examples:


  Pei forager: https://m.facebook.com/kate.macquarrie.37/posts/3078968342327243 

  Italian Bread dude: Instagram and newsletter over site 

  Why does Steve publish to linked in 

  Why does vertex publish to medium

  Why do I search google maps for store hours or restaurant menus?

  40th bday party to Facebook event 

  Infrared fitness - mind body 


  It’s all about the  Followers

  Bread dude promotes: newsletter or Instagram over his WP site? Why? His count
  goes up (the value of his digital presence is measured in followers).

  Followers is the currency for anyone publishing to the web: can be extended to
  non web publishing (podcasts, YouTube, etc). 

  The web doesn’t come with followers. (RSS was a solution kinda)

  This is why substack is taking off (followers and ease of use)

  A BIG ONE Sharing in networks gets you more followers, and often attention
  from non followers  

  It’s all about exposure

  Publish my party event to Facebook: easy comms medium - most people are there,
  centralized feed of comms around an ephemeral event  

  Running a community yard sale fundraiser for Ukraine ? 

  FB : people will share and you’ll a greater exposure

  Twitter: write a Twitter thread instead of a blog post and and people will
  retweet and …

  Linked in’s algorithms will share your post on [insert subculture topic here]
  to relevant audience 

  [a driver of exposure and platform success] It’s all about the UX for your
  audience 

  And end user  experience, like Tom (article above) mentioned, you get so much
  for free: Instagram images swipe perfectly on mobile, the images swipe and UX
  are so much better, lazy loads, the worlds best UX teams are continually
  improving these experiences because the worlds biggest businesses depend on a
  UX that will delight and engage users.

  Medium is solving these for bloggers (sadly it’s a walled garden) (compare a
  medium article with a PG article 

  It’s all about community 

  With the platform web, you can interact with your followers and they can
  interact with each other. Hard to do well on open web. Think WP comment spam. 

  Ie comments on your bread recipe

  Ie coach Steve’s posts to Linkedin 

  But do  I want to interact with random users on Disqus? No, I prefer the HN
  community, because I feel like they’re my people. This is probably more
  relevant when the community you’re engaging with is your friends on
  facebook.  

  It’s all about ease of use - creator experience 

  You get so much for free: snap some Instagram pics, apply filters, type your
  recipe, all from your phone. etc.  then engage your community and watch your
  follower count increase 

  An independent food truck can create a Twitter account and start ammassing
  followers so much easier than building a site. 

  Do not have to worry about spam (in comments etc)



  Could publishing to the open web become as easy as posting to Twitter?  Could
  you ammase followers more easily? 


  So why the independent web then?

  Single source of truth for a business 

  Brand

  Wherever you’re an freelance illustrator or a Fortune 500 company, brand
  matters

  Independence (fringe concern): for web purests


  Why is the web important:

  It’s the only truly non walled garden. 

  It’s incredibly hackable (customizable and extendable)

  It’s a gateway platform to lean how to code

  It’s one of humanity’s greatest triumphs  

  You can be anonymous: read an article without logging in. You can toggle your
  identity on and off. 



  Build Medium.com but

  Open source 

  Eject any time 

  No log in required for readers 

  Completely free - Wikipedia model

  Hackable (I.e. think MySpace)



  Is this what web 3 people are trying to solve?

The web is one of humanity's greatest triumphs.&#x20;

I recently read Tom MacWright's [2020 post](https://macwright.com/2020/08/22/clean-starts-for-the-web.html) on the state of the web. I come across posts like this every now, where enthusiasts of the open web lament the current state of the web.&#x20;

I believe in the open web. My company’s mission is to redefine how we publish to the web. Yet I observe the world choosing social platforms over the open web and I have a hypothesis as to why. 

Mention that I’m sad to see this trend. 

I read Tom’s post and although he has some good ideas, I think he really misses the mark.
