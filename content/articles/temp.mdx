The Open Web is one of humanity's greatest triumphs.

By "Open Web", I mean the *public* side of the web that's viewable by *anyone* and made up of open-source technologies, open standards, and democratic concepts.  I like how Mark Surman of Mozilla [describes it here](https://www.yearofopen.org/november-open-perspective-what-is-open-web/what-is-the-open-web-and-why-is-it-important-submitted-by-mark-surman-executive-director-of-the-mozilla-foundation/):&#x20;

> A web by and forÂ *all*Â its users, not select gatekeepers or governments

Or Tim Berners Lee's [definition](https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2017/nov/15/tim-berners-lee-world-wide-web-net-neutrality):

> open platform that allows anyone to share information, access opportunities and collaborate across geographical boundaries

I want to see the web thrive as a public resource for generations to come. That's why I'm sad when I see people choosing centralized platforms like Facebook, Medium, Instagram, and Linkedin over the independant, Open Web to publishing content.

**Include this? ðŸ‘‡**

I often hear people say things like *"\*\*I liked the web better when it was just HTML and CSS"*.   Javascript isn't what's hurting the web (unless you're talking about recipe websites ðŸ˜‰), it's that ...

**So, why are people ditching the Open Web in favor of centralized platforms like Facebook, Medium, etc?**

## Platforms increase your reach

I love the [Primitive Technology](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAL3JXZSzSm8AlZyD3nQdBA) Youtube channel. Where, from the comfort of my office, I watch a guy go into the bush with nothing but a pair of shorts on and builds shelters, smelts iron, and grows food.  His videos get many millions of views and he has over 10 million subscribers.  He also has a WordPress site where he shares his videos and writes posts to go along with them. Yet it hasn't been updated his site since 2018.  On Youtube,&#x20;

*   A BIG ONE Sharing in networks gets you more followers, and often attention from non followersÂ Â 
*   Publish my party event to Facebook: easy comms medium - most people are there, centralized feed of comms around an ephemeral eventÂ Â 
*   Running a community yard sale fundraiser for Ukraine ?Â 
    *   FB : people will share and youâ€™ll a greater exposure
    *   Twitter: write a Twitter thread instead of a blog post and and people will retweet and â€¦
    *   Linked inâ€™s algorithms will share your post on \[insert subculture topic here] to relevant audienceÂ 
*   \[a driver of exposure and platform success] Itâ€™s all about the UX for your audienceÂ 
    *   And end userÂ  experience, like Tom (article above) mentioned, you get so much for free: Instagram images swipe perfectly on mobile, the images swipe and UX are so much better, lazy loads, the worlds best UX teams are continually improving these experiences because the worlds biggest businesses depend on a UX that will delight and engage users.
    *   Medium is solving these for bloggers (sadly itâ€™s a walled garden) (compare a medium article with a PG articleÂ 

### Build a following
![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqgj7ufiw/image/upload/v1654393234/blog/followers_cnxb2b.png)

*   Related to incrase reach, followers are the digital currency of a content creator. &#x20;
*   Bread dude promotes: newsletter or Instagram over his WP site? Why? His count goes up (the value of his digital presence is measured in followers).
*   Followers is the currency for anyone publishing to the web: can be extended to non web publishing (podcasts, YouTube, etc).Â 
*   The web doesnâ€™t come with followers. (RSS was a solution kinda)

![](https://res.cloudinary.com/dqgj7ufiw/image/upload/v1654394396/blog/followers-squared_vied41.png)

*   This is why substack is taking off (followers and ease of use)
*   A BIG ONE Sharing in networks gets you more followers, and often attention from non followersÂ Â 

## Interact with your friends

*   With the platform web, you can interact with your followers and they can interact with each other. Hard to do well on open web. Think WP comment spam.Â 
    *   Ie comments on your bread recipe
    *   Ie coach Steveâ€™s posts to LinkedinÂ 
*   But doÂ  I want to interact with random users on Disqus? No, I prefer the HN community, because I feel like theyâ€™re my people. This is probably more relevant when the community youâ€™re engaging with is your friends on facebook.Â Â 

## Ease-of-use

*
*   You get so much for free: snap some Instagram pics, apply filters, type your recipe, all from your phone. etc.Â  then engage your community and watch your follower count increaseÂ 
*   An independent food truck can create a Twitter account and start ammassing followers so much easier than building a site.Â 
*   Do not have to worry about spam (in comments etc)

Could publishing to the open web become as easy as posting to Twitter?Â  Could you ammase followers more easily?Â 

So why the independent web then?

*   Single source of truth for a businessÂ 
*   Brand
    *   Wherever youâ€™re an freelance illustrator or a Fortune 500 company, brand matters
*   Independence (fringe concern): for web purists

Why is the web important:

Itâ€™s the only truly non walled garden.Â 

Itâ€™s incredibly hackable (customizable and extendable)

Itâ€™s a gateway platform to lean how to code

Itâ€™s one of humanityâ€™s greatest triumphsÂ Â 

You can be anonymous: read an article without logging in. You can toggle your identity on and off.Â

## Conclusion

Ask yourself why your blogger is using Medium. Or why that new restaurant is only on facebook. Or why that food blogger is sending people to their instagram account.&#x20;

Nowadays, when people talk about decentralization and the web,  it's usually followed by Web 3 technology.  But I think to build the everlasting open platform that we all want, we need to solve these fundamental issues for Web 2, the Open Web.&#x20;

Build Medium.com but

*   Open sourceÂ 
*   Eject any timeÂ 
*   No log in required for readersÂ 
*   Completely free - Wikipedia model
*   Hackable (I.e. think MySpace)

Is this what web 3 people are trying to solve?Â

Bad on mobileÂ 

NOTE START

> Social networks are universally more restrictive than web pages but also more fun in significant ways, chief amongst them being that more people can participate. What if the rest of the web have that simplicity and immediacy, but without the centralization? What if we could start over?

> The appeal of social networks is partly because they let us create documents without thinking about web technology, and they provide guarantees around performance, accessibility, and polish that otherwise would take up our time. You donâ€™t have to think about whether your last Facebook post will load quickly on your friendâ€™s phone or whether your Instagram post will be correctly cropped and resized in the timeline - those things are taken care of.

> To some extent, this doesnâ€™t need to be something that only social networks provide, though: standards like RSS and services like Instapaper show that pleasing formatting and distribution can be done at the platform level and be provided on top of existing vanilla websites.

Ask myself why someone publishes to a network instead of a website. Why do I browse google maps to find my restaurant hours? Examples:

*   Pei forager: [https://m.facebook.com/kate.macquarrie.37/posts/3078968342327243](https://m.facebook.com/kate.macquarrie.37/posts/3078968342327243)Â 
*   Italian Bread dude: Instagram and newsletter over siteÂ 
*   Why does Steve publish to linked inÂ 
*   Why does vertex publish to medium
*   Why do I search google maps for store hours or restaurant menus?
*   40th bday party to Facebook eventÂ 
*   Infrared fitness - mind bodyÂ 

More notes:&#x20;

Why would someone choose medium.com?&#x20;

*   \* Followers
*   \* Likes
*   \* Easy/good comment system
*   \* Writing experience
*   \* Access to audience
*   \* Cool/credible brand
